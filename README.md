Biography of a Proper Mad Feudor Krikman

I was born under the hot sun of Zimbabwe, where the lizards do push-ups and the mangoes fall like rain if you just shout at the tree. From small-small, I knew life was not going to be easy â€” not when your best friends are one sad giraffe, one broke-down elephant, and one lion that looked like he fought the wind and lost.

University? Ah, I went o! Not just one, but many, chasing wisdom like it owed me money. My giraffe used to carry my books, my elephant cried during exams (heâ€™s a sensitive guy, you know?), and that lion? Useless for study, but great for scaring professors when grades were low.

Now, what do I want in this life? Not gold, not diamonds, not even a nice pair of shoes (okay, maybe one nice pair). All I truly desire is many glasses of water at the same time â€” yes o, luxury hydration! â€” and respect from every last baboon in the village. If the baboons nod when I pass, I know I have made it.

People say Iâ€™m mad â€” I say, "Better mad with purpose than sane with boredom." I dance with goats, argue with chickens, and I once beat a crocodile in a staring contest (donâ€™t ask how, itâ€™s a long story).

So if you see me walking with my crew â€” long-necked scholar, sad-trumpet thinker, and patchy king of the bush â€” just greet me well. I might bless you with a proverb or steal your sandwich. Depends on the weather.
